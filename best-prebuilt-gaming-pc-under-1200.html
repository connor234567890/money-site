<h2>Is $1200 Enough for Good Gaming?</h2>

<h3>1080p Performance</h3>
<p>
At this budget, you can expect high refresh rate 1080p gaming in most titles. Esports games like Call of Duty, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Valorant will run very smoothly.
</p>

<h3>1440p Capability</h3>
<p>
With RTX 4060 Ti builds, 1440p is achievable by adjusting settings and enabling DLSS. It’s not ultra-max territory in every title, but performance is strong for the price.

<h2>What to Look for Under $1200</h2>

<h3>GPU First</h3>
<p>
The graphics card is the most important component for gaming. Look for RTX 4060 or RTX 4060 Ti systems in this price range.
</p>

<h3>16GB RAM Minimum</h3>
<p>
Modern games require at least 16GB of RAM. Avoid 8GB systems.
</p>

<h3>NVMe SSD Storage</h3>
<p>
Make sure the PC includes an NVMe SSD for fast load times. 1TB is ideal at this price.
